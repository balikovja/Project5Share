Functions left in Functions.java and why:
adjacent - utility method nothing helped by putting in point
processLine - utility method, no idea where else you would put it
all parse methods - utility methods, no idea where else you would put them
all create methods - utility methods, no idea where else you would put them
clamp - utility method with no logical/necessary place besides Functions.java
distanceSquared - utility method with no logical/necessary place besides Functions.java
setAlpha - felt unnecessary to move, didnt seem to go anywhere and didnt work in imagestore
load - nothing gained by putting in a class
nearestEntity - nothing gained by putting in a class
getImages - felt unnecessary to move, didnt seem to go anywhere and didnt work in imagestore
processImageLine - utility method, no idea where else you would put it
getCurrentImage - didnt seem to belong anywhere and was no problem in functions. Made it seem unnecessary to move
